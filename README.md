# LookUp

Repository for the plane tracking app: Look Up
‘Look Up’ is a mobile app that transforms a smartphone into a personal atmospheric
tracker. Through mixed reality, the user points the device's camera at the sky, and then users can
instantly identify airplanes and satellites passing overhead in real-time with a dynamic HUD that
attaches to the flying objects. Overlaid would be detailed information such as flight numbers,
airline names, destinations, and for satellites their purpose (communication, GPS, research, etc.)
directly to the screen. ‘Look Up’ brings you to the sky, whether you’re an aviation enthusiast,
stargazer, or simply just curious.
